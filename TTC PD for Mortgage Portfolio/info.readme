The model was developed using US Mortgage data from Fannie Mae, focusing on creating a Through-the-Cycle (TTC) 
Probability of Default (PD) model in line with Basel IRB requirements. The dataset comprised panel data for 50,000 IDs, 
with the objective of converting these observations into a cross-sectional model base that could be used for further model development.

Key steps in the process included:
--Designing the model base for annual performance and snapshots, and transforming the panel data into cross-sectional data.

--Employing statistical methods such as Chi-Square tests, Paired t-tests, and Weight of Evidence (WoE) for feature selection.

--Developing models using a range of algorithms, including Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, AdaBoost, XGBoost, 
Naive Bayes, and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), achieving a maximum accuracy of 76% with the Random Forest algorithm.

--Validating the models using metrics such as Confusion Matrix, ROC-AUC, and Gini coefficient, and testing various assumptions as 
part of the validation process.
