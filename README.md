These models are essential for financial institutions to evaluate the risk associated with lending to borrowers and to maintain the health of their loan portfolios.

What's in the bucket?
Multiple Models: Includes logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, gradient boosting.
Data Preprocessing: Scripts for cleaning, feature engineering, Weight of Evidence, Information Value, Fine Classing and Coarse Classing.
Model Evaluation: Tools for assessing model performance using metrics like Confusion Matrix, ROCAUC, precision, recall, and F1 score.
Model monitoring: Monitoring out of time data using Population stability index (PSI).
